        "description": "This dataset contains information about 1000 individuals and was collected through a nationwide health survey. It includes demographic information such as education level (in years), age (in years), income (in USD), and a health score that takes into account various health factors. It also includes binary information about the individual's gender and smoking status. Additionally, it records if an individual was exposed to an anti-smoking campaign (1 for exposed, 0 for not exposed) and their lung cancer risk score. Lastly, an instrumental variable is included: the number of hours the individual watches TV per week. The anti-smoking campaign exposure is assumed to be directly related to the amount of TV watched as the campaign was primarily disseminated through television. The motivation for this study is to examine the effectiveness of the anti-smoking campaign in reducing lung cancer risk.",

Variables include age, years of education, income, work hours per week, gender (0 for male, 1 for female), urban residence (1 for urban, 0 for rural), whether the individual received job training (treatment), and job satisfaction score. The instrumental variable is the company's policy, which influences whether an employee receives job training but does not directly affect job satisfaction. The data was collected through an online survey distributed to employees across various industries nationwide. The motivation for the study was to better understand the factors influencing job satisfaction and the effectiveness of job training programs.",
