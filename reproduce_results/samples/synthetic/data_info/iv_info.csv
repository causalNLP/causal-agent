Synthetic Dataset,"This dataset contains information about 1000 individuals and was collected through a nationwide health survey. It includes demographic information such as education level (in years), age (in years), income (in USD), and a health score that takes into account various health factors. It also includes binary information about the individual's gender and smoking status. Additionally, it records if an individual was exposed to an anti-smoking campaign (1 for exposed, 0 for not exposed) and their lung cancer risk score. Lastly, an instrumental variable is included: the number of hours the individual watches TV per week. The anti-smoking campaign exposure is assumed to be directly related to the amount of TV watched as the campaign was primarily disseminated through television. The motivation for this study is to examine the effectiveness of the anti-smoking campaign in reducing lung cancer risk.","""Did the exposure to the anti-smoking campaign through television have an impact on reducing the risk of lung cancer among individuals?""",1.6755042719092241,iv,iv_data_0.csv
