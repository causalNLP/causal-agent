The data includes information on county minimum wage policies, poverty rates, average income, unemployment rates, and whether the county is urban or rural. It also includes data on the education level of the county, categorized as either 'high' (more than 50% of the population holds a bachelor's degree or higher) or 'low' (less than 50% holds a bachelor's degree). The data was collected from various government databases and is being used to study the impact of minimum wage policies on poverty rates.",
