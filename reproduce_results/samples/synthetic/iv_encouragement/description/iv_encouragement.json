        "description": "The dataset was collected as part of a public health initiative that aimed to promote physical well-being among adults. A group of 1000 adults were randomly invited to participate in a structured exercise program. The dataset includes information about the individual's age, gender, smoking status, and alcohol consumption habits. The outcome variable is the individual's physical health score, a metric derived from several health markers including cardiovascular fitness, flexibility, and body composition. The treatment variable indicates whether the individual ended up participating in the exercise program. This study was conducted to understand how participation in an exercise program influences physical health, taking into consideration factors such as age, gender, smoking status, and alcohol consumption.",
