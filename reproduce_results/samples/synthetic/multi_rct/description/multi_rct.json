        "description": "This dataset was collected from a social science study aimed at exploring the impact of different career development interventions on job satisfaction among adults in the USA. The study was executed using a multi-treatment randomized control trial design. The participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups: control (no intervention), career counselling, career mentoring, or a combination of career counselling and mentoring. The continuous covariates collected include the number of years of education (education_years) and income in thousands of dollars (income_thousands). Binary covariates were collected to indicate gender (0 for male, 1 for female), minority status (0 for non-minority, 1 for minority), and city residence (0 for rural, 1 for urban). The outcome variable is the job satisfaction score obtained from a standardized job satisfaction survey, with higher scores indicating greater job satisfaction.",

The subjects of the study were adults from various socio-economic backgrounds. The study aimed to determine the effect of different types of social support interventions on the overall life satisfaction of these adults, considering various socio-economic factors such as education level, income level, presence of children, urban or rural living, and marital status. The interventions were of three types - no intervention, financial counseling, and stress management sessions. The outcome variable, life satisfaction, was measured using a standardized questionnaire. The data were collected through surveys administered before and after the interventions.",
