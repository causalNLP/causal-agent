The study aimed to evaluate the impact of a newly implemented community exercise program on the health of residents. Data was collected from a random selection of individuals over two periods - before the implementation of the exercise program and after its implementation. The variables captured include income level, age, gender, marital status, an overall health score, and whether or not the individual participated in the exercise program. The health score is a composite measure based on various health indicators, such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and body mass index. The exercise program was randomly offered to certain residents, allowing for a comparison between those who participated in the program (treated) and those who did not (untreated).",
