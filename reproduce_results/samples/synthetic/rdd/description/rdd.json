The age, income, gender, and region of the individuals were recorded. The running variable is the individual's credit score, with the cutoff point being a score of 12. Individuals with a credit score above 12 were more likely to receive the subsidy. The outcome variable is the rate of homeownership. The study is designed to assess the effect of the subsidy program on homeownership rates, controlling for age, income, gender, and region. The data was collected through surveys and credit score records.",
