The survey asked participants about their age, years of education, annual income (in thousands), average work hours per week, gender, smoking habits, and marital status. Additionally, half of the participants were randomly selected to partake in a year-long exercise program. At the end of the year, participants' health was evaluated using a composite health score, which takes into account factors like heart rate, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and mental wellbeing. The purpose of the study was to assess the impact of regular exercise on overall health.",

The study collected demographic data (age, gender, marital status, whether they live in an urban area), socio-economic data (education level, income level, work hours per week, family size), and whether they received financial literacy training. The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of financial literacy training on the amount of savings.",
