Social Pressure and Voter Turnout: Evidence from a Large-Scale Field Experiment,"The randomized experiment aims to analyze the effect of different types of social pressures on voter behavior. A field experiment was conducted in Michigan ahead of the August 2006 primary election. 
Households were randomly assigned to a control group or one of four treatment groups: Civic Duty, Hawthorne, Self, Neighbors. Eleven days before the election, each treatment group received a different mailing:
Civic Duty: Emphasized the recipient’s responsibility as a citizen to vote.
Hawthorne: Notified recipients that their voting behavior would be studied using public records, introducing mild social pressure.
Self: Listed the voting history of all registered voters in the household and noted that an updated chart would be mailed after the election.

Government Transfers and Political Support,"
The study focuses on the Uruguayan Plan de Atención Nacional a la Emergencia Social (PANES), described as a large, temporary social relief program. PANES ran from April 2005 to December 2007. PANES included several components. The main part was a monthly cash transfer. Eligibility for the PANES program was determined using a predicted income score. This score was based on household socioeconomic characteristics collected during a baseline survey. Households were eligible only if their predicted income score fell below a predetermined threshold.

"The Demand for, and Impact of, Learning Hiv Status.","This dataset comes from a randomized field experiment conducted in rural Malawi between May and August 2004, as part of the Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change Project (MDICP). The MDICP is a long-term study involving approximately 120 villages across three districts: Rumphi, Mchinji, and Balaka. As part of the program, respondents were offered a free HIV test administered at home. To encourage participants to collect their test results, they were randomly given vouchers of varying value, redeemable at nearby voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) centers. Voucher amounts were determined by drawing tokens from a bag. Researchers then recorded whether participants retrieved their results from the assigned VCT center.

Markets: The Fulton Fish Market,"The dataset was collected from the Fulton Fish Market, a historic wholesale fish market in New York City. The purpose of the data collection was to examine the economic and institutional dynamics of how the market functioned. Fish were sold in bulk to a wide range of buyers, including restaurants, retail shops, and independent vendors. Transactions typically took place in the early morning hours, with prices and quantities influenced by factors such as day of the week, weather conditions, and supply levels.
Sales were higher on Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays, compared to  Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Sellers in the market set prices individually for each customer. The dataset focuses specifically on whiting, a commonly traded fish in the market. Price information was gathered directly through daily visits to the market and from reports provided by salesmen.
