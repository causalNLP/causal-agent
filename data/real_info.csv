Social Pressure and Voter Turnout: Evidence from a Large-Scale Field Experiment,"
This study aims to determine the extent to which social norms influence voter turnout. The authors conduct an randomized experiment to encourage voters to consider their civic duty while applying different levels of social pressure.

Data Collection Process:

* Field Experiment Setting: The experiment was conducted in Michigan before the August 2006 primary election.
* Random Assignment: Households were randomly assigned to either a control group or one of four treatment groups.
* Mailings: Treatment groups received one of four mailings 11 days before the primary election. The mailings aimed to emphasize civic duty and apply varying degrees of social pressure.
* Data Acquisition: Voter turnout data was obtained from public records after the August 2006 election.

Data Collected:

* Treatment Group: Assignment to one of the four mailing treatments:
* Civic Duty: Reminded recipients of their rights and responsibilities as citizens, urging them to vote. This group voted at a rate of 31.5%.
* Hawthorne Effect: Informed recipients that their voting behavior would be studied using public records, introducing a mild form of social pressure. This increased turnout to 32.2%.
* Self: Listed the recent voting record of each registered voter in the household, indicating who voted in past elections and implying that an updated chart would be mailed after the primary. Turnout climbed to 34.5% in this group.
* Neighbors: Listed both the household's voting records and the voting records of nearby residents, suggesting that voting behavior would be publicized within the neighborhood. Turnout in this experimental group was 37.8%.

Black Politicians Are More Intrinsically Motivated to Advance Blacks’ Interests: A Field Experiment Manipulating Political Incentives,"
The black_politicians dataset contains data from Broockman (2013) on a field experiment in which fictional emails, purportedly from Black constituents, were sent to U.S. legislators. The experiment tested whether being ""out-of-district"" (i.e., not a potential voter) reduced the likelihood of a response. The hypothesis was that Black legislators might be more intrinsically motivated to respond to Black constituents, showing smaller effects of the out-of-district condition compared to non-Black legislators.

Government Transfers and Political Support,"
The study focuses on the Uruguayan Plan de Atención Nacional a la Emergencia Social (PANES), described as a large, temporary social relief program. PANES ran from April 2005 to December 2007. PANES included several components. The main part was a monthly cash transfer. Eligibility for the PANES program was determined using a predicted income score. This score was based on household socioeconomic characteristics collected during a baseline survey. Households were eligible only if their predicted income score fell below a predetermined threshold.


Variables

Don't Take 'No' For An Answer: An Experiment With Actual Organ Donor Registrations,"The state of California enacted an active-choice phrasing for their organ donation sign-up question in Q32011. Data was collected on actual organ donation registration rates in California and other U.S. states over time.

"The Demand for, and Impact of, Learning Hiv Status.","The study is based on a field experiment conducted in rural Malawi between May and August of 2004, as part of the Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change Project (MDICP). The MDICP is an ongoing study in approximately 120 villages across three districts: Rumphi, Mchinji, and Balaka. The participants in this experiment were men and women who were part of the original MDICP sample (randomly selected from households in 1998, interviewed in 1998, 2001, and 2004) and an additional sample of young adults (ages 15–24) added in 2004. The experiment involved offering respondents a free door-to-door HIV test. Of the 3,185 respondents offered a test, 2,894 accepted (91 percent), forming the main sample of 2,812 individuals who also had basic covariate data and non-indeterminate results.

After samples were taken for the HIV test, respondents were given randomly assigned vouchers redeemable upon obtaining their results at a nearby VCT center. The voucher amounts were randomized by letting each respondent draw a token from a bag.  Attendance at centers to obtain results was also measured.


The dataset includes the following model variables:
site: Region of Malawi where the study was conducted (1 = Mchinji, 2 = Balaka, 3 = Rumphi)
rumphi: Dummy indicator for Rumphi (1 if in Rumphi)
balaka: Dummy indicator for Balaka (1 if in Balaka)
villnum: Village ID

got: Indicator if the respondent obtained HIV results (1 = learned HIV results)
zone: Indicator of assigned VCT center/zone (values 1–16 for each VCT center)
distvct: Distance (in km) from the randomly assigned VCT center
tinc: Total value of the incentive in Malawi Kwacha
Ti: Discrete incentive levels (e.g., 0; 10–50; 60–100; 110–200; 210–300 Malawi Kwacha)
any: Indicator of receiving any positive-valued incentive
under: Indicator for residing within 1.5 km of the assigned VCT center
over: Indicator for residing over 1.5 km from the assigned VCT center
simaverage: Average simulated distance from a VCT center (computed by randomly drawing household locations within a VCT zone)
age: Reported age of the respondent in 2004
male: Indicator if the respondent is male

 Do Voters Affect or Elect Policies: Evidence from the U.S. House,"The study investigates whether elected officials moderate their behavior based on narrowly divided electorates. If electing a candidate from a specific party in a close race leads to large policy shifts, it implies that the elected official pursues their own agenda. Conversely, small or null effects suggest policy moderation toward the center. The data primarily consists of roll-call voting records of U.S. House Representatives and election returns data. Roll-call voting behavior is measured using several indices, with the main one being the Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) voting score, which ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a more liberal voting record.
